    <h2>The Objective</h2>
    <p>This website helps assess the digital maturity of SMEs through two main axes, divided into several dimensions and measurable KPIs.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-section fade-in">
    <h2>How does it work?</h2>
    <p>To begin, a company account must be created by a manager. Once registered, the manager receives a unique Company Code.</p>
    <p>This code can be shared with employees, allowing them to answer the survey without creating their own account.</p>
    <p>The survey asks role-specific questions to both managers and employees.</p>
  </section>

  <section class="about-section fade-in">
    <h2>How can I see my results?</h2>
    <p>Once all participants complete the survey, the company owner can log in, click on "My Results", and generate a full maturity report based on the latest data.</p>
